# About

Educational use only, for serious applications use real libraries like Boost.

Multiple significantly different implementations are accepted, including in different languages and using different libraries.

Solutions to *algorithmic* programming exercises are accepted. If after modeling the problem it boils down to a single well known algorithm algorithm, only state the model and which algorithm to use, but don't code anything.
