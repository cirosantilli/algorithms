Algorithms and solutions to algorithmic exercises.

Preferred languages: C++ and Python, but every language and non stdlib library is accepted, but you must provide an automated installation procedure.

Multiple significantly different implementations are accepted, including in different languages and using different libraries.

Every algorithm is tested on a standard virtual machine with fixed memory and CPU, and has CPU time measured.

Intuitive explanation and complexity analysis are accepted.

Solutions to *algorithmic* programming exercises are accepted. If after modeling the problem it boils down to a single well known algorithm algorithm, only state the model and which algorithm to use, but don't code anything.

# Places where you can find algorithmic problems

Most of the websites don't have solutions. One good way to search for unofficial solutions to GitHub search for the contest name.

Automatic checks online:

- [TopCoder](http://www.topcoder.com/active-challenges/develop). No solutions. 6M registered users. Money prizes. Some company proposed problems have Non Disclosure Agreements. Timed submission contests.
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/categories/fp/intro). No solutions, 3M Round A. Timed submission contests.
- [Sphere Online Judge (SPOJ)](http://www.spoj.com/problems/classical/all/).  No solutions. 200K users, 10000 problems.
- [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/problems). 350K users, only ~450 problems. No solutions. Since 2001. Probably one of the oldest around, but did not evolve much.
- [UVa](http://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=1). 100K registered users. No solutions. Slow website.

Yearly contests:

- [ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest](http://icpc.baylor.edu/). [Wiki](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM_International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest).  No solutions. Eligibility: less than five years of university education before the contest. Started in 1977. [World final problems](http://icpc.baylor.edu/worldfinals/problems).
- [Google Code Jam](http://code.google.com/codejam/contests.html). Only a few solutions.
- [ICFP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICFP_Programming_Contest). One problem per year. Since 1998.
